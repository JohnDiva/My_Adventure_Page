                in which he read about in a newspaper years ago. Fortunately, the treasure was not found after
                countless attempts by rich ducks who spent money for their workers go to find it.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Luckt Duck then went to an old friend of his who lives upstream and ask him to accompany him
                because he knows the stream well like his own palmate.        
            </p>
            <p>
                They search the stream which was believed to be the hosts of the treasure. They search
                throughly and skillfully and eventually found the treasure of value 1,000,000.00 dollar.
                The lucky dark gladly shared the money 500,000.00 dollar each and they become business partners.
